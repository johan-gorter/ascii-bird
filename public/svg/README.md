This folder can be used to create custom SVG files for assets for the game.

SVG Files are simple and flat 
The coordinates match the bird size (40 high, 40 wide) and game world (450 high)

- To keep assets visually consistent, add depth using gradients to create a 3D effect, as seen in `pipe.svg`.
